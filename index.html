                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hey, I'm Charlie. I'm a recent graduate from Bates College (class of '24), where I majored in Economics
                    and minored in Digital and Computational studies. Over the course of my studies, I developed a love for coding and data analysis. 
                    I primarily work in R,
                    but am comfortable working in Python, Java, and Stata as well. I'm also dabbling in HTML, though mostly in order
                    to create a website (the one you are now viewing). You can find examples of my work on this website!
                </p>
                <h3>Athletics</h3>
                <p> 
                    During my time in college, I rowed for the Bates Men's varsity rowing team. I competed in the top varsity eight for 
                    three of those four years, en route to earning DIII All-American, All-NESCAC, and scholar-athlete honors. My senior year, I was elected captain
                    team as well. I largely credit those years in developoing my work ethic and time management skills, as I balanced the 25hrs
                    a week with my studies.

                </p>
                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    While I'm not actively rowing, I'm still passionate about staying fit and enjoy cycling, swimming, and weight-lifting. 
                    I also love tinkering in just about any form, be it replacing parts on my bike or sewing shorts, hats, and bike bags. If there's 
                    no tinkering to be done, I enjoy reading
