                <h1>Public-Transit/Rideshare Partnerships</h1>
                <p>In partial fulfillment of my Economics degree, I completed a thesis entitled  "Assessing the Impact of Public Transit-Rideshare Partnerships." 
                    I examined the effect that partnerships between rideshare companies and public-transit agencies have on transit ridership. These partnerships took 
                    the form of subsidized rides, usually from Uber or Lyft, to and from transit stations.

                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        To find agencies and ridership numbers,
                        I took ridership data from the National Transit Database (NTD) for each agency in the country, and identified what agencies implemented 
                        partnerships at what time. I also used the American Census Survey (ACS) to find demographic information for each urbanized area (UZA).
                        I linked the UZA demographic data with the UZA the transit agency was associated with in order to confirm that demographic
                        characteristics were not driving ridership growth in agencies with a partnership versus agencies without.

            <h3>Methodology/Results</h3>
            <p>
                While I had initially planned on a standard difference-in-difference specification, the staggered timing forced me to look into a 
                staggered difference-in-difference. This regression technique is susceptible to bias with unbalanced treatment and control groups, as 
                well as to heterogeneous treatment effect, both of which my data exhibited. To combat this, I used interaction-weighted (IW) estimators 
                (Sun and Abraham, "Estimating dynamic treatment effects in event studies with heterogeneous treatment effects", 2021).

                        This method led to a finding of a 5% increase in transit ridership as a result of these partnerships. However, this increase 
                        varies based on the agency. The cohort plot shows the different treatment effect by when the partnership was launched.
                        The results of the regression can be found in the table.
